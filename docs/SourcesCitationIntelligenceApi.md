## get_cited_url_content

> get_cited_url_content(project_id, url_sha256)
Cited URL cached content

Unavailable page content keeps the cited URL and citation metrics. Page metadata/content and unknown brand_mentioned/competitor_mentioned return null. content_gap_status is content_unavailable (or missing_page_cache) without usable content, and mentions_not_processed when the page has usable content but its mention analysis has not completed for this project. Mention fields (brand_mentioned, competitor_mentioned, brand_position, brands, mentions, content_gap_status) describe the analysis for the requesting project: a page not yet analyzed for it returns null (never false) brand_mentioned, competitor_mentioned and brand_position, empty brands and mentions arrays and page_cache.mentions_processed false. page_cache.mentions_processed is true exactly when brand_mentioned is not null. An analyzed page keeps its last result until a newer analysis replaces it. status_code shows a saved successful response or observed 404/410; other crawl failures and error_message are hidden. last_crawled_at dates the saved copy. Domain/host crawled_urls_count counts usable copies; brand_mentioned_urls_count and competitor_mentioned_urls_count count only URLs analyzed for the project and are null when none is.

### Parameters

## get_cited_url_detail

> get_cited_url_detail(project_id, url_sha256, model, collection_id, country_code, language_code, prompt, brand_kind, from, to, source_type, sentiment, content_gap, include_series)
Cited URL detail

Unavailable page content keeps the cited URL and citation metrics. Page metadata/content and unknown brand_mentioned/competitor_mentioned return null. content_gap_status is content_unavailable (or missing_page_cache) without usable content, and mentions_not_processed when the page has usable content but its mention analysis has not completed for this project. Mention fields (brand_mentioned, competitor_mentioned, brand_position, brands, mentions, content_gap_status) describe the analysis for the requesting project: a page not yet analyzed for it returns null (never false) brand_mentioned, competitor_mentioned and brand_position, empty brands and mentions arrays and page_cache.mentions_processed false. page_cache.mentions_processed is true exactly when brand_mentioned is not null. An analyzed page keeps its last result until a newer analysis replaces it. status_code shows a saved successful response or observed 404/410; other crawl failures and error_message are hidden. last_crawled_at dates the saved copy. Domain/host crawled_urls_count counts usable copies; brand_mentioned_urls_count and competitor_mentioned_urls_count count only URLs analyzed for the project and are null when none is. The filters narrow stats and citation_series alike. citation_series (with include_series=true) holds the answers citing the URL under the same filters: granularity (day, week or month, from the account tracking cadence, with weeks when a daily account spans more than 60 days, starting on Monday), total (equal to total_responses), by_model (answers per AI model, largest first, which can include enabled models outside the seven the model filter accepts) and data, one { date, value } point per period that holds a filtered answer, so a zero means answers ran and none cited it. Periods date each answer by its executed_at in Europe/Madrid time, the column from and to filter.

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**project_id** | **i32** | Project ID | [required] |
**url_sha256** | **String** | 64-character hex SHA-256 of the cited URL | [required] |
**model** | Option<**String**> | Filter by one AI model. Only chatgpt, ai_overview, ai_mode, perplexity, gemini, naver_ai and baidu_ai are accepted: any other value, including another model enabled for the API key's user, returns 422 ERR_INVALID_PARAM (invalid model). One of those seven that the user has not enabled also returns 422 ERR_INVALID_PARAM, with the valid values in the message. |  |
**collection_id** | Option<**String**> | One collection/tag ID or a comma-separated list of IDs. A query value is always a string on the wire, so it is typed as one: the previous integer-or-string union made generators emit a wrapper type they could not serialize. |  |
**country_code** | Option<**String**> | One ISO country code or a comma-separated list (e.g. US,GB,DE) |  |
**language_code** | Option<**String**> | One ISO language code or a comma-separated list (e.g. en,es,de) |  |
**prompt** | Option<**i32**> | Filter by prompt ID |  |
**brand_kind** | Option<**String**> | Filter by brand kind: brand (own brand/products), brand_other (competitors/other brands), non_brand (generic, no brand named). For fair 1:1 brand-vs-competitor comparisons (visibility, share of voice), use non_brand: brand-focused prompts skew results toward the brand they name. The in-app Overview page applies non_brand by default. |  |
**from** | Option<**chrono::DateTime<chrono::FixedOffset>**> |  |  |
**to** | Option<**chrono::DateTime<chrono::FixedOffset>**> | End of the window. A date-only value such as 2026-09-01 covers that whole day. Pass a full timestamp to end the window earlier. |  |
**source_type** | Option<**String**> |  |  |
**sentiment** | Option<**String**> |  |  |
**content_gap** | Option<**String**> | mentioned: the cited page mentions your brand. gap: it mentions a competitor but not your brand. Only pages with usable content whose mention analysis has completed for this project match. |  |
**include_series** | Option<**bool**> | Adds citation_series. Without it the response is unchanged. |  |[default to false]

## get_mentions_by_citing_domain

> get_mentions_by_citing_domain(project_id, domains, model, collection_id, country_code, language_code, prompt, brand_kind, from, to)
Mention share by citing domain

For the responses where each given source domain is cited, returns the share of those responses that mention the brand vs each competitor (brand + competitors sum to 100% per domain). Pass multiple domains to get the whole matrix in one call.

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes

Only chatgpt, ai_overview, ai_mode, perplexity, gemini, naver_ai and baidu_ai are accepted: any other value, including another model enabled for the API key's user, returns 422 ERR_INVALID_PARAM (invalid model). One of those seven that the user has not enabled also returns 422 ERR_INVALID_PARAM, with the valid values in the message. |  |
**collection_id** | Option<**String**> | One collection/tag ID or a comma-separated list of IDs. A query value is always a string on the wire, so it is typed as one: the previous integer-or-string union made generators emit a wrapper type they could not serialize. |  |

## list_citation_groups

> list_citation_groups(project_id, view, page, per_page, order, direction, model, collection_id, country_code, language_code, prompt, brand_kind, from, to, key, include_series, query, source_type, sentiment, content_gap)
Grouped citation intelligence

Grouped citation intelligence by url / domain / host with per-model breakdown, citation rate, and avg citation position. Counts and citation rate include visible citations and background source references. Average position ignores rows with position=0. Owned and competitor source matching honor the project's exact-subdomain setting. Filter vocabulary aligns with `source_type` returned by the API. Unavailable page content keeps the cited URL and citation metrics. Page metadata/content and unknown brand_mentioned/competitor_mentioned return null. content_gap_status is content_unavailable (or missing_page_cache) without usable content, and mentions_not_processed when the page has usable content but its mention analysis has not completed for this project. Mention fields (brand_mentioned, competitor_mentioned, brand_position, brands, mentions, content_gap_status) describe the analysis for the requesting project: a page not yet analyzed for it returns null (never false) brand_mentioned, competitor_mentioned and brand_position, empty brands and mentions arrays and page_cache.mentions_processed false. page_cache.mentions_processed is true exactly when brand_mentioned is not null. An analyzed page keeps its last result until a newer analysis replaces it. status_code shows a saved successful response or observed 404/410; other crawl failures and error_message are hidden. last_crawled_at dates the saved copy. Domain/host crawled_urls_count counts usable copies; brand_mentioned_urls_count and competitor_mentioned_urls_count count only URLs analyzed for the project and are null when none is. Pass key to read one group; brand_kind filters by the brand focus of the prompts, like the source page. citation_series (with include_series=true) holds the answers citing the URL, domain or host under the same filters: granularity (day, week or month, from the account tracking cadence, with weeks when a daily account spans more than 60 days, starting on Monday), total (equal to total_responses), by_model (answers per AI model, largest first, which can include enabled models outside the seven the model filter accepts) and data, one { date, value } point per period that holds a filtered answer, so a zero means answers ran and none cited it. Periods date each answer by its executed_at in Europe/Madrid time, the column from and to filter.

**project_id** | **i32** | Project ID | [required] |
**view** | Option<**String**> |  |  |[default to url]
**page** | Option<**u32**> |  |  |[default to 1]
**per_page** | Option<**u32**> |  |  |[default to 20]
**order** | Option<**String**> |  |  |
**direction** | Option<**String**> |  |  |
**model** | Option<**String**> | Filter by one AI model.

**key** | Option<**String**> | Return only this group of the chosen view: a domain (view=domain), a host (view=host) or a cited URL exactly as listed (view=url). Domains and hosts match case-insensitively, without www. A view=url key is one raw URL, so its variants (a tracking parameter, a trailing slash) stay separate rows; GET /citation_intelligence/urls/{url_sha256} merges them, as the app does. No match returns an empty list (total 0), not an error. |  |
**include_series** | Option<**bool**> | Requires key, else 422 ERR_INVALID_PARAM. Adds citation_series to the group's row. |  |[default to false]

List source URLs

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**project_id** | **i32** | Project ID | [required] |
**page** | Option<**u32**> |  |  |[default to 1]
**per_page** | Option<**u32**> |  |  |[default to 20]
**model** | Option<**String**> | Filter by one AI model. It must be a model enabled for the API key's user: an unknown value, or a model the user has not enabled, returns 422 ERR_INVALID_PARAM with the valid values in the message. |  |
**collection_id** | Option<**String**> | One collection/tag ID or a comma-separated list of IDs. A query value is always a string on the wire, so it is typed as one: the previous integer-or-string union made generators emit a wrapper type they could not serialize. |  |
**country_code** | Option<**String**> | One ISO country code or a comma-separated list (e.g. US,GB,DE) |  |

**prompt** | Option<**i32**> | Filter by prompt ID |  |
**from** | Option<**chrono::DateTime<chrono::FixedOffset>**> |  |  |
**to** | Option<**chrono::DateTime<chrono::FixedOffset>**> | End of the window. A date-only value such as 2026-09-01 covers that whole day. Pass a full timestamp to end the window earlier. |  |
**source_type** | Option<**String**> | Filter by source ownership. Owned and competitor matching honor the project's exact-subdomain setting. Any other value, including a differently cased one, returns ERR_INVALID_PARAM. |  |
**mention_filter** | Option<**String**> | Filter by which brands are mentioned, as a two-axis matrix (your brand x competitors): mentions_you / not_mentions_you, mentions_competitor / not_mentions_competitor, and the four combined cells you_and_competitor, competitor_not_you (a rival wins and you are absent), you_not_competitor, no_brands (no tracked brand appears, i.e. open space). Combine with 'competitors' to narrow the competitor side to specific rivals; on a negative cell that reads 'none of these'. On /dimensions/sources it applies to the crawled content of each cited page instead of the answer text. The legacy value 'competitors_only' is still accepted as an alias of competitor_not_you. |  |
**competitors** | Option<**String**> | Comma-separated competitor IDs (unknown IDs return ERR_INVALID_PARAM) |  |
**output** | Option<**String**> | Rectangular output for BI tools (Tableau, Excel, Sheets, ELT). Omit for the default nested JSON. 'flat' returns the same metadata plus 'columns' and 'rows'; 'csv' returns those rows as text/csv. Errors are always returned as JSON. |  |
