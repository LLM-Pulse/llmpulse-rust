## create_api_key

> models::CreateApiKey201Response create_api_key(create_api_key_request)
Create an API key limited to projects

Creates an API key limited to the projects in project_ids, owned by the same user as the calling key, and returns its secret token once: store it, since it cannot be read again. The key sees only those projects (any other project answers ERR_PROJECT_NOT_FOUND) and cannot act on the whole account, and the set of projects never changes. This endpoint never creates an account-wide key; create one in the app under API Keys. scope is read (default) or read_write. Every project must be one the caller can access: a project of another account, a deleted one or an unknown id answers ERR_PROJECT_NOT_FOUND and nothing is created. A user can hold up to 500 active keys; past that the request answers ERR_LIMIT_REACHED until a key is revoked. Requires an account-wide `read_write` scope API key on the Scale plan or above: a key limited to some projects answers ERR_KEY_PROJECT_SCOPED. A team member needs permission to create API keys and can only choose projects they can access.

## list_api_keys

> models::ListApiKeys200Response list_api_keys(page, per_page)
List API keys

Lists the API keys of the user the calling key belongs to, newest first, revoked ones included: name, the visible prefix of the token, scope (read or read_write), the projects a key is limited to (project_scoped, project_ids; an empty list on an account-wide key), when it was created and last used, and when it was revoked. The secret token is only ever returned once, by POST /api_keys. Requires an account-wide `read_write` scope API key: a key limited to some projects answers ERR_KEY_PROJECT_SCOPED. Still answers after the account moves below the Scale plan, so old keys can be found and revoked. A team member needs the API Keys permission and sees only their own keys.

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**page** | Option<**i32**> |  |  |
**per_page** | Option<**i32**> | Default 20, max 100 |  |

## revoke_api_key

> models::RevokeApiKey200Response revoke_api_key(id)
Revoke an API key

Revokes an API key of the user the calling key belongs to: it stops working immediately and cannot be restored. Revoking a key that is already revoked answers the same way and keeps its original revocation time. A key of another user answers ERR_NOT_FOUND. The calling key can revoke itself. Requires an account-wide `read_write` scope API key: a key limited to some projects answers ERR_KEY_PROJECT_SCOPED. Still answers after the account moves below the Scale plan. A team member needs permission to delete API keys.

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **i32** | The key id from GET /api_keys | [required] |

### Return type

[**models::RevokeApiKey200Response**](revokeApiKey_200_response.md)

### Authorization

[BearerAuth](../README.md#BearerAuth)

### HTTP request headers

- **Content-Type**: Not defined
- **Accept**: application/json
