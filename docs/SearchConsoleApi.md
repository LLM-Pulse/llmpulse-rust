## get_search_console_pages

> get_search_console_pages(project_id, range, from, to, sort, page, per_page, output, search_type, filters, data_state)
Top Search Console pages (Growth+)

Top Google Search Console landing pages over a date range, ranked by impressions, clicks, ctr or position, paginated. Requires a connected Search Console property (Growth+). X-Search-Console-Backend identifies stored or live reads. Stored reads use synced data without contacting Google. Live reads return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_ACCESS_REVOKED (403) for revoked Google access; reconnect the property in Preferences > Project Settings > Data Connections. They return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_UPSTREAM (503) when Google Search Console is unavailable or over quota; wait for the number of seconds in Retry-After before retrying. total counts distinct keys available for the range: keys from synced daily rows for stored reads, or up to 25,000 rows from one Google request for live reads. Live responses include truncated: true when that limit is reached. Sorting and pagination apply to the available set.

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Required | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**project_id** | **i32** | Project ID | [required] |
**range** | Option<**i32**> | Number of days to look back (alternative to from/to) |  |
**from** | Option<**chrono::DateTime<chrono::FixedOffset>**> |  |  |
**to** | Option<**chrono::DateTime<chrono::FixedOffset>**> | End of the window. A date-only value such as 2026-09-01 covers that whole day. Pass a full timestamp to end the window earlier. |  |
**sort** | Option<**String**> |  |  |[default to impressions]
**page** | Option<**u32**> |  |  |[default to 1]
**per_page** | Option<**u32**> |  |  |[default to 20]
**output** | Option<**String**> | Rectangular output for BI tools (Tableau, Excel, Sheets, ELT). Omit for the default nested JSON. 'flat' returns the same metadata plus 'columns' and 'rows'; 'csv' returns those rows as text/csv. Errors are always returned as JSON. |  |
**search_type** | Option<**String**> | Which search surface to measure. Defaults to web. discover and googleNews carry no query dimension, so Google rejects /search_console/queries for them. |  |[default to web]
**filters** | Option<**String**> | Narrow the query; every entry must match (AND). Send the whole list as one JSON value: filters=[{\"dimension\":\"page\",\"operator\":\"contains\",\"expression\":\"/blog/\"}] (URL-encoded). An array of objects has no query-parameter form a generated client can produce, so the string is what the official SDKs send; see the SearchConsoleFilters schema for the shape it encodes. includingRegex and excludingRegex take RE2 syntax. At most 10 entries, expression at most 500 characters. The bracket form filters[][dimension]=page&filters[][operator]=contains&filters[][expression]=/blog/ is also accepted. |  |
**data_state** | Option<**String**> | final (default) counts only rows Google has finalized. all also counts the most recent days, which are still being filled in and will change. |  |[default to final]

## get_search_console_queries

> get_search_console_queries(project_id, range, from, to, sort, page, per_page, output, search_type, filters, data_state)
Top Search Console queries (Growth+)

Top Google Search Console search queries over a date range, ranked by impressions, clicks, ctr or position, paginated. Excludes anonymized queries; for headline totals use /search_console/summary. Requires a connected Search Console property (Growth+). X-Search-Console-Backend identifies stored or live reads. Stored reads use synced data without contacting Google. Live reads return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_ACCESS_REVOKED (403) for revoked Google access; reconnect the property in Preferences > Project Settings > Data Connections. They return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_UPSTREAM (503) when Google Search Console is unavailable or over quota; wait for the number of seconds in Retry-After before retrying. total counts distinct keys available for the range: keys from synced daily rows for stored reads, or up to 25,000 rows from one Google request for live reads.

## get_search_console_summary

> get_search_console_summary(project_id, range, from, to, dimension, limit, search_type, filters, data_state)
Search Console summary (Growth+)

Google Search Console headline totals (impressions, clicks, ctr as a 0..1 fraction, average position) for the project over a date range. Pass dimension=country, device, page, query or searchAppearance to also receive the breakdown aggregated over the range, capped by limit. Requires the project to have a connected Search Console property and the Growth plan or above; otherwise returns ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_NOT_CONNECTED or ERR_PLAN_REQUIRED. X-Search-Console-Backend identifies stored or live reads. Stored reads use synced data without contacting Google. Live reads return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_ACCESS_REVOKED (403) for revoked Google access; reconnect the property in Preferences > Project Settings > Data Connections. They return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_UPSTREAM (503) when Google Search Console is unavailable or over quota; wait for the number of seconds in Retry-After before retrying.

Search Console time series (Growth+)

Google Search Console property-wide series (impressions, clicks, ctr, position) bucketed by day, week or month. Requires a connected Search Console property (Growth+). X-Search-Console-Backend identifies stored or live reads. Stored reads use synced data without contacting Google. Live reads return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_ACCESS_REVOKED (403) for revoked Google access; reconnect the property in Preferences > Project Settings > Data Connections.
